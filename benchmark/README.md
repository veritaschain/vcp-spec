# AI Decision Auditability Benchmark (v1.0)

This directory contains the official **AI Decision Auditability Benchmark** published by the  
**VeritasChain Standards Organization (VSO)**.

This benchmark is:

- **NOT** an implementation guide  
- **NOT** a product  
- **NOT** a certification scheme  

It is a **vendor-neutral evaluation standard** for assessing the *auditability and evidence quality* of AI and algorithmic decision systems.

---

## Purpose

As AI systems increasingly move toward autonomous decision-making, regulators and auditors face a structural challenge:

> Can AI-driven decisions be independently verified by a third party, without relying on vendor trust?

This benchmark provides a **common, repeatable measure** to answer that question.

---

## Primary Use Cases

- Pre-audit diagnostics and scoping  
- AI assurance methodology and consistency across engagements  
- Regulatory evidence quality assessment  
- Repeatable client-facing audit pre-assessment

## Benchmark Components

This directory includes the following official documents:

- **Scorecard**  
  Defines *what* is evaluated (10 criteria, 20-point scale)

- **PoC / Assessment Guide**  
  Defines *how* the benchmark can be applied in approximately 3 hours

- **Evidence Pack Template**  
  Defines *how results are submitted* as third-party audit or regulatory evidence

- **EU AI Act Mapping Annex**  
  Maps benchmark criteria to EU AI Act Articles 12, 13, 14, and 17, and MiFID II / RTS requirements

## Theoretical Foundation

The benchmark is grounded in open cryptographic principles and cross-jurisdictional regulatory analysis.

A formal theoretical paper explaining **why open cryptographic standards are structurally necessary for AI auditability** is available on Zenodo:

- **Why Open Cryptographic Standards Matter for AI Auditability:  
  Formal Analysis and Regulatory Alignment**  
  https://zenodo.org/records/17947483

This paper introduces the *Verification Paradox* and demonstrates why proprietary audit systems cannot provide true third-party verifiability by design.

## Relationship to VCP and VAP

- **VCP (VeritasChain Protocol)** provides a concrete, domain-specific implementation profile for algorithmic trading systems.
- **VAP (Verifiable AI Provenance Framework)** generalizes these principles across high-risk AI domains.
- This **Benchmark** serves as a vendor-neutral *measurement layer* for auditability, independent of any specific implementation.
